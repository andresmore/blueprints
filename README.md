# Welcome to this repository!

This repository stores the [__software development blueprints__](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/blueprints/blob/main/blueprints.md) for _Epiverse-TRACE_. You can:

* view the blueprints in [markdown format](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/blueprints/blob/main/blueprints.md) on github 

* download them in [pdf format](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/blueprints/raw/main/blueprints.pdf)

* download them in <a href="https://github.com/epiverse-trace/blueprints/raw/main/blueprints.html" download="epiverse_trace_blueprints.html">html format</a> 

Note: github may show you the html source instead of downloading the file; if
that happens, right click on the newly opened page and save the file as
'blueprints.html' (or any name of your choosing).




__Questions__ and __comments__ on the blueprints are welcome through [github issues](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/blueprints/issues).
